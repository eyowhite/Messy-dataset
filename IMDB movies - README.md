## •	Output:
o	A clean dataset (Cleaned_IMDB_Dataset.csv) that is ready for analysis.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning in any data analysis pipeline. By following the steps in this project, you can transform messy, unreliable data into a clean dataset that can be used for accurate and meaningful analysis.
