# Data Cleaning Project: Handling a Messy Healthcare Dataset

The full project [is here](https://eyowhite.com/how-to-clean-a-healthcare-data-using-python/).

# Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning a messy healthcare dataset using Python and Pandas. The dataset contains information such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, visit dates, and more. The primary goal is to address various data quality issues, including missing values, inconsistent formats, and incorrect entries, to prepare the dataset for accurate analysis.

# Key Data Cleaning Steps

## 1.	Loading the Dataset: 
      The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
## 2.	Stripping Leading/Trailing Spaces: 
      Unnecessary spaces in string columns are removed.
## 3.	Correcting Non-Numeric Values: 
      Non-numeric values in numeric columns (e.g., Age) are corrected.
## 4.	Standardizing Date Formats: 
      The Visit Date column is standardized to a consistent format.
## 5.	Handling Missing Values: 
      Missing values are filled with appropriate defaults or statistical measures.
## 6.	Rounding and Converting Columns: 
      The Age and Cholesterol columns are rounded and converted to integers to remove decimal places.
## 7.	Removing Duplicates: 
      Duplicate rows are identified and removed.
## 8.	Detecting Outliers: 
      Outliers are detected using various statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).

# How to Use
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.	Ensure that you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.).
3.	Place the original dataset (healthcare_messy_data.csv) in the appropriate directory.
4.	Run the Python script (data_cleaning_script.py) to clean the dataset.
5.	Check the output (cleaned_healthcare_messy_data.csv) to review the cleaned data.

## Dependencies
•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the essential steps in cleaning a real-world, messy dataset. The cleaned data can now be used for more accurate analysis and decision-making. The provided tutorial document further explains each step in detail, making it a valuable resource for those new to data cleaning.
