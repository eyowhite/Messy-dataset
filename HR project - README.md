# HR Dataset Cleaning Project

Find the [project here](https://eyowhite.com/how-to-clean-a-messy-hr-data-using-python/).

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning a messy HR dataset using Python. The dataset contains common issues such as inconsistent formatting, incorrect data types, missing values, and irregular categorical entries. By following the steps outlined in this project, you'll learn how to transform such a dataset into a clean and analysis-ready format.

# Project Structure
•	data/: Contains the original messy HR dataset (large_messy_data.csv) and the cleaned dataset (cleaned_large_messy_data.csv).
•	scripts/: Python scripts used to clean the dataset.
•	docs/: Documentation files, including the tutorial and any other relevant documentation.
•	README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
•	Python 3.x
•	Required Python Libraries: pandas, numpy

# Key Steps in the Data Cleaning Process
•	Loading the Dataset: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
•	Trimming Extra Spaces: Removing leading and trailing spaces from text fields.
•	Correcting Data Types: Converting strings to appropriate numeric or date formats.
•	Standardizing Data Formats: Ensuring consistency in date formats and categorical variables.
•	Handling Missing Values: Filling or dropping missing data as necessary.
•	Final Data Validation: Verifying the cleaned data for accuracy and completeness.
•	Saving the Cleaned Data: Exporting the cleaned dataset for further analysis.
